### Decisions

* README: I decided to add a read me page because it is common practice and helps define the general outline of my github repository. Moreover, it provides useful information such as introductions and installation guides.
* License: I chose to apply an MIT license to my repository because it is simple and highly permissive which allows for open source. 
* Permissions: I made my repository public for my classemates viewing purposes.
